OctoAI has multiple trust & safety capabilities to detect and potentially block NSFW content, including a prompt filter and image classifier.

**Prompt filter**
The prompt filter is applied to the image generation prompt. If a prompt is blocked, the API response will include: 
`"message":"This request violates our Acceptable Use Policy."`

**Image classifier**
The image classifier is applied to the generated image. If an image is classified as NSFW, the API response will include:
`"removed_for_safety":true`

Images uploaded for fine-tuning are also assessed using the image classifier, and the API response will designate an NSFW image using the `status` field
`"status":"rejected"`
