OctoAI has multiple trust & safety capabilities to detect and potentially block NSFW content, including a prompt filter and image classifier.

**Prompt filter**

The prompt filter is applied to the image generation prompt. If a prompt is blocked, we'll return a 400 code and the API response will include `"message":"This request violates our Acceptable Use Policy."`

**Image classifier**

The image classifier is applied to the generated image. If an image is classified as NSFW, the image won't be returned and the API response will include `removed_for_safety:true`. Example response:

```
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image_b64": "null",
      "removed_for_safety": true,
      "seed": 1
    }
  ],
}
```

Images uploaded for fine-tuning are also assessed using the image classifier, and the API response will designate NSFW images within the `rejected_assets` field.
