OctoAI currently runs on AWS and GCP hardware in several regions - including AWS us-east-1 and us-west-2 regions, and GCP us-central-1 region. We are actively expanding support for more regions.

For customers with data residency requirements, [OctoStack](https://octo.ai/docs/private-deployment/octostack) can be hosted in your own private cloud environment or on your own hardware. [Contact our sales team](https://octo.ai/octostack-demo/) for more information.
