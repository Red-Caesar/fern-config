  There are multiple ways in which customers can build a RAG application on
  OctoAI.

OctoAI allows customers to [run their choice of LLMs](/docs/text-gen-solution/getting-started)
(like Llama 3 8B, Llama 3 70B, Mixtral 8x22B) and embedding models (like gte-large). With these primitives, customers can use their preferred vector database as the reference data store for their RAG application. OctoAI also supports integrations with popular LLM application development frameworks like LangChain, allowing the use of pre-built functions in [LangChain](/docs/integrations/langchain) to simplify their RAG application development.

Lastly, OctoAI supports integrations into turnkey RAG frameworks like PineCone Canopy for customers to easily implement RAG with their data.
