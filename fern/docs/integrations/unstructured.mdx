## Introduction

Unstructured is both an open-source library and an API service. The library provides components for ingesting and pre-processing images and text documents, such as PDFs, HTML, Word docs, and many more.

It also provides components to very easily embed these documents. In Unstructuredâ€™s jargon this component is called an EmbeddingEncoder. The OctoAIEmbedingEncoder is available, so documents parsed with Unstructured can easily be embedded with the OctoAI embeddings endpoint.

## Using the OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder

Before you get started let's review some concepts. You will need an [OctoAI API Token](/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-octoai-access-token) for this integration.

- The `OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder` class connects to the OctoAI Text&Embedding API to obtain embeddings for pieces of text.
- `embed_documents` will receive a list of Elements, and return an updated list which includes the embeddings attribute for each Element.
- `embed_query` will receive a query as a string, and return a list of floats which is the embedding vector for the given query string.
- `num_of_dimensions` is a metadata property that denotes the number of dimensions in any embedding vector obtained via this class.
- `is_unit_vector` is a metadata property that denotes if embedding vectors obtained via this class are unit vectors.

Now, let's get started with the following code example for how to use `OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder`.
You will see the updated elements list (with the `embeddings` attribute included for each element),
the embedding vector for the query string, and some metadata properties about the embedding model.
You will need to set an environment variable named `OCTOAI_API_KEY` to be able to run this example.

```python
import os

from unstructured.documents.elements import Text
from unstructured.embed.octoai import OctoAiEmbeddingConfig, OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder

embedding_encoder = OctoAIEmbeddingEncoder(
    config=OctoAiEmbeddingConfig(api_key=os.environ["OCTOAI_API_KEY"])
)
elements = embedding_encoder.embed_documents(
    elements=[Text("This is sentence 1"), Text("This is sentence 2")],
)

query = "This is the query"
query_embedding = embedding_encoder.embed_query(query=query)

[print(e.embeddings, e) for e in elements]
print(query_embedding, query)
print(embedding_encoder.is_unit_vector(), embedding_encoder.num_of_dimensions())
```
