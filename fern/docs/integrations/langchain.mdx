## Introduction
LangChain provides a framework to easily build LLM-powered apps. Developers using LangChain can now utilize OctoAI LLMs and Embedding endpoints
to access efficient, fast, and  reliable compute. 


## Using OctoAI's LLMs and LangChain
To use OctoAI LLMs with LangChain, first [obtain an OcotoAI API Token](../getting-started/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token.mdx). 
Then paste your API token in the code example below:

```python
import os

os.environ["OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"] = "OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"
os.environ["ENDPOINT_URL"] = "https://text.octoai.run/v1/chat/completions"
```
Next, run the following Python script:
```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms.octoai_endpoint import OctoAIEndpoint
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = """Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n Instruction:\n{question}\n Response: """
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

llm = OctoAIEndpoint(
    model_kwargs={
        "model": "llama-2-13b-chat-fp16",
        "max_tokens": 128,
        "presence_penalty": 0,
        "temperature": 0.1,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Keep your responses limited to one short paragraph if possible.",
            },
        ],
    },
)

question = "Who was leonardo davinci?"

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

print(llm_chain.run(question))
```

It should produce the following output:
```
  Sure thing! Here's my response:

Leonardo da Vinci was a true Renaissance man - an Italian polymath who excelled in various fields, 
including painting, sculpture, engineering, mathematics, anatomy, and geology. He is widely considered 
one of the greatest painters of all time, and his inventive and innovative works continue to inspire and 
influence artists and thinkers to this day. Some of his most famous works include the Mona Lisa, 
The Last Supper, and Vitruvian Man.
