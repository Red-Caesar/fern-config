subtitle: SSD-1B, a distilled version of SDXL generates images 50% faster than SDXL.

The primary advantage of utilizing Stable Diffusion SSD lies in its remarkable efficiency, boasting a 50% faster speed compared to SDXL, owing to its more compact design. Moreover, OctoAI has implemented its exclusive compiler and cloud system optimizations, culminating in an unparalleled end-to-end average generation speed of 1.4 seconds â€” establishing it as the swiftest iteration of SSD-1B available in the market.

However, it's essential to acknowledge certain limitations inherent to the SSD-1B model. Due to its distillation into a smaller form, the resultant output images deviate from those produced by SDXL. In essence, even with identical seed and API parameters, replicating the same output images as SDXL is no longer feasible. Furthermore, the community surrounding this novel model remains comparatively modest in size compared to that of SDXL. Consequently, the availability of finely-tuned assets such as checkpoints and LoRAs for tailoring styles, objects, and facial features is notably limited.

```Python Python
