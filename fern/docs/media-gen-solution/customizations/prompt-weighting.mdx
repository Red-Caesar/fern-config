You can emphasize, or de-emphasize, specific words or phrases of the image generation prompt using weighting. To use prompt weighting, format your prompt using parentheses: `prompt = "A cat with (long whiskers)"`

    This emphasizes the phrase “long whiskers” with a weight of `1.1`. Adding additional parentheses such as `"\(\(\(long whiskers)))"` performs additional multiples of `1.1`, so for 3 sets of parentheses, the weight would be `1.33`. More specific weights can also be specified in the form: `prompt = "A cat with (long whiskers: 0.8)"`

    This will weigh all words in the parentheses by a factor of `0.8`. Notably, weights do not have to be greater than one. Using a weight of less than 1 will de-emphasize the contained words.

     Using weights in negative prompts can also be helpful. For example, you can avoid distorted hands: `negative_prompt = "(distorted hands: 1.5)"`
