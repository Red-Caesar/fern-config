### Uninstall octoai-sdk

```bash
pip uninstall octoai-sdk
pip install octoai
```

### Upgrading your code

The various OctoAI APIs are now accessable from a single client:

```python
from octoai.client import OctoAI

client = OctoAI()

# The various APIs are now accessible from the client
client.text_gen

client.image_gen

client.fine_tuning

client.asset_library
```

### Image Generation API changes

In the `octoai.image_gen` API instead of specifying which
engine to use, use the corresponding `generate_*` method.

### Text Generation API changes

The text generation models with `octoai.text_gen` API are now specified with a `str` model name instead of an `enum`.

Streaming requests are made with the corresponding `octoai.text_gen.*_stream` method.

### Asset Library (Asset Orchestrator) API changes

The Asset Orchestrator has been renamed to Asset Library and can be accessed via `octoai.asset_library`. Assets can be created with the `octoai.asset_lirbary.create_from_file`.

### `octoai.service` API changes

The `octoai.service` API has been removed. You can make inferences to compute service endpoints via `OctoAI` client:

```python
from octoai.client import OctoAI

client = OctoAI()

# octoai.infer()
```

However you will need to continue to use the older `octoai-sdk` for the full `octoai.service` API which includes service authoring.
