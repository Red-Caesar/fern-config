title: Upgrading from @octoai/client
slug: typescript-sdk/upgrading-from-old-sdk
---


### Uninstall octoai-sdk

```bash
npm uninstall @octoai/client
npm install @octoai/sdk
```

### Upgrading your code

The various OctoAI APIs are now accessable from a single client:

```typescript
import { OctoAIClient } from '@octoai/sdk';

const client = new OctoAIClient();

// The various APIs are now accessible from the client
client.textGen

client.imageGen

client.fineTuning

client.assetLibrary
```

### Image Generation API changes

In the `client.imageGen` API instead of specifying which
engine to use, use the corresponding `generate_*` method.

### Text Generation API changes

The text generation models with `client.textGen` API are now specified with a `string` model name instead of an `enum`.

Streaming requests are made with the corresponding `client.textGen.*_stream` method.

### Asset Library (Asset Orchestrator) API changes

The Asset Orchestrator has been renamed to Asset Library and can be accessed via `client.assetLibrary`. Assets can be created with the `client.assetLibrary.upload()` method.

### Compute Inferencing API changes

The `infer()` method is not yet available in this sdk.  You will need to continue to use the older `@octoai/client` for full inferencing support.
