### Migrating to the new SDK package

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm uninstall @octoai/client
npm install @octoai/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn remove @octoai/client
yarn add @octoai/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm remove @octoai/client
pnpm add @octoai/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Upgrading your code

The various OctoAI APIs are now accessible from a single client:

```typescript TypeScript
import { OctoAIClient } from "@octoai/sdk";

const octoai = new OctoAIClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OCTOAI_TOKEN,
});

// The various APIs are now accessible from the client
octoai.textGen;
octoai.imageGen;
octoai.fineTuning;
octoai.assetLibrary;
```

### Image Generation API changes

In the `octoai.imageGen` API, instead of specifying which engine to use, use the corresponding `generate*` method such as `generateSdxl()` or `generateSd()`.

### Text Generation API changes

The text generation models with `octoai.textGen` API are now specified with a `string` model name instead of an `enum`.

Streaming requests are made with the corresponding `octoai.textGen.*Stream` method such as `createCompletionStream()` or `createChatCompletionStream()`.

### Asset Library (Asset Orchestrator) API changes

The Asset Orchestrator has been renamed to Asset Library and can be accessed via `octoai.assetLibrary`. Assets can be created with the `octoai.assetLibrary.upload()` method.

### Compute Inferencing API changes

The `infer()` method is not available in this SDK. You will need to continue to use the older `@octoai/client` for full inferencing support.
