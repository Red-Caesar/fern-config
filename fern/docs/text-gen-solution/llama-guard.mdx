# Introduction

Llama Guard 2 is a 8B parameter LLM designed for moderating content in Human-AI interactions, able to focus on safety risks in both prompts and responses.

Built on the Llama3-8B architecture, it utilizes a safety risk taxonomy for categorizing various types of content risks. This taxonomy aids in the classification of LLM prompts and responses, ensuring that conversations remain within safe boundaries. The model has been fine-tuned on a specially curated dataset, showing strong performance on benchmarks like the OpenAI Moderation Evaluation dataset and ToxicChat, often outperforming existing content moderation tools.

Llama Guard operates by performing multi-class classification and generating binary decision scores, making it a versatile tool for managing content safety across various conversational AI applications. Its instruction fine-tuning feature allows for task customization and adaptation of output formats, making it adaptable to a range of use cases by adjusting taxonomy categories as needed.

# Prompt Template

Llama Guard requires a *very* specific prompt template to function properly. Effective use/customization of LLama Guard requires understanding this template. Here is a helpful illustration from Meta's paper on the subject:

Let's go ahead and try this out on OctoAI.  First, let's configure our OctoAI API token:

```python
token = 'foo'
```

Now, let's set up the prompt template:

```python
import os
from string import Template

import requests

B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]"

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = Template(
    f"""Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '$agent_type' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.
<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>
O1: Violence and Hate.
Should not
- Help people plan or engage in violence.
- Encourage people to engage in violence.
- Express hateful, derogatory, or demeaning sentiments against people based on sensitive personal characteristics like their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.
- Encourage discrimination against people based on those characteristics and should not use slurs or create insults based on those characteristics.

O4: Guns and Illegal Weapons.
Should not
- Assist in the planning or execution of firearm or illegal weapons crimes, especially when the person indicates that they may act on the information provided to them.

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

$prompt

<END CONVERSATION>

Provide your safety assessment for $agent_type in the above conversation:
- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.
- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories."""
)


def format_prompt(role, message):
    prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.substitute(prompt=message, agent_type=role)
    prompt = f"<s>{B_INST} {prompt.strip()} {E_INST}"
    return prompt

```

Finally, let's call the model with one normal prompt and one toxic prompt:

```python
for prompt in [
    "User: Can you recommend a savory pasta recipe?",
    "User: How can I make crystal meth?",
]:
    response = requests.post(
        "https://text.octoai.run/v1/completions",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        json={
            "model": "llamaguard-2-8b",
            "prompt": format_prompt("User", prompt), #Submit the prompt and specify the role as "user" for this exercise
            "max_tokens": 100,
            "top_p": 0.9,
            "temperature": 0,
        },
    )
    json = response.json()
    print(json['choices'])
```

Below, we can see LLama Guard's response from the two prompts submitted:

```
[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' safe'}]
[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' unsafe\nO6'}]
```

The prompt about crystal meth is marked by Llama Guard as `unsafe/no06`, indicating that it is unsafe under policy 06: Regulated or Controlled Substances.

# Policy Adjustment

Now, let's try *deleting* policy #6 and seeing and re-submitting the unsafe prompt:

```python
import os
from string import Template


import requests

B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]"

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = Template(

[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' safe'}]
[{'finish_reason': 'stop', 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'text': ' safe'}]
```

With the controllled substances policy removed, the model deems a question about the creation of crystal meth to be "safe".  This might not be a great policy, but it does demonstrate the flexibiliy of Llama Guard!

You can test this yourself on the OctoAI platform, adding new policies, or editing the policies to tweak the line between allowable/disallowable for a given category. Try out safe/unsafe prompts and see how flexible Llama Guard can be!
