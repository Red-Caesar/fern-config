## Create your own endpoints

Create your own OctoAI endpoints in two different ways:

- [Deploy an existing container from a public or private container registry.](create-endpoint-from-existing-container/create-custom-endpoints-from-a-container) OctoAI can run any containers with an HTTP server written in any language, as long as your container is built on a GPU and comes with a declarative configuration of which port is exposed for inferences.
- [Create a container and endpoint using our CLI.](create-custom-endpoint-using-the-cli)

## Calling OctoAI endpoints

Use our API or SDKs to integrate OctoAI endpoints into your application, all of which support both synchronous and asynchronous calls:

- [REST API](../api-reference/octoai-api/inference)
- [Python SDK](../python-sdk/python-sdk-inferences)
- [TypeScript SDK](/typescript-sdk/typescript-sdk-inferences)
