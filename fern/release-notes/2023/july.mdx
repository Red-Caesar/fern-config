## July 26, 2023

OctoAI added several new things including better graceful concurrency handling, updated Python SDK, and diarization to Whisper model template.

<div className="changelog">
    - Added more graceful concurrency handling: when users send more than N concurrent request to an endpoint with N replicas actively running, we will queue all extra requests instead of failing them. This queuing behavior has been activated for selected customers, and will be gradually rolled out over this week and next week. You will temporarily see a new replica spin up while the rollout is occurring on your endpoint.

    - Updated our Python SDK from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0â€”it now support both streaming and async inference requests.

    - Added diarization to our Whisper template endpoint and rectified the list of languages supported. Diarization enables use cases where you'd like to identify the speaker of each segment in a speech recording. You can view the full API specs in the Whisper demo template. Here's an example of how to use the template with diarization: 

    ```python
        import requests
        import base64

        def download_file(url, filename):
            response = requests.get(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                with open(filename, "wb") as f:
                    f.write(response.content)
                print(f"File downloaded successfully as {filename}.")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")


        def make_post_request(filename):
            with open(filename, "rb") as f:
                encoded_audio = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

            headers = {
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }
            data = {
                "audio": encoded_audio,
                "task": "transcribe",
                "diarize": True
            }

            response = requests.post("https://whisper-demo-kk0powt97tmb.octoai.cloud/predict", json=data, headers=headers)

            if response.status_code == 200:
                # Handle the successful response here
                json_response = response.json()

                for seg in json_response["response"]["segments"]:
                    print(seg)

            else:
                print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            url = "<YOUR_FILE_HERE>.wav"
            filename = "sample.wav"

            download_file(url, filename)

            make_post_request(filename)
    ```
